The E-Bill Management System is a robust and efficient web-based application developed using PHP and SQL, designed to streamline the billing process and manage user information effectively. This project serves as a comprehensive solution for handling electronic billing, offering features that allow for easy filtering, sorting, and management of user data.

The system's primary functionality revolves around the ability to filter user information based on various criteria, such as date of billing, user ID, or payment status. This filtering capability ensures that users can quickly access relevant billing information, significantly reducing the time and effort required to manage large datasets. The system supports data entry, retrieval, and modification, ensuring that all user information is up-to-date and accurate.

The backend is powered by SQL, providing a stable and secure database to store user information and transaction details. SQL queries are utilized to perform complex data operations, including filtering, searching, and generating reports, which are then displayed to the user through a dynamic and user-friendly PHP interface.
